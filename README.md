Task App

This application is part of a Udemy.com course React-The Complete Guide(incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)
by Maximilian Schwarzmuller.


This is a simple application where the user simply writes out a task to be done and submits it by entering the "Add Task" button.
The user may add as many tasks as they please and they will all be displayed in the order in which they were added.


This application taught me to use backend database programs such as Firebase, using fetchTasks, hooks such as use State and useEffect and adding task items using set Task and taskHandler, etc.


Running the attached code You can use the attached code simply to compare it to yours. But you can also run it. To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal first. Then run npm install to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder). Run npm start to pull up application on your computer. Important: You always download the entire branch content!

Important: If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use your backend URLs or API keys. Mine won't work (I disabled my projects)
